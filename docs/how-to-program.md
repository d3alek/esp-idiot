![ESP-12 programming wire-up](esp-12-programming-wire-up.png)

1. Connect as shown in esp-12-programming-wire-up.png (solid lines). Red and black are necessary to boot, green to wake up from sleep.
2. Connect VCC and GND to a 3.3V power source. Cannot be USB powered reliably because the ESP uses 500ma at peaks. 
3. Connect the dotted lines to the programmer.
